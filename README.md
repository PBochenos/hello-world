# hello-world

As in the environment in which I work, I always try to look for inspiration, passion, new challenges and follow what
interests me, I found something that would give me joy of work and motivate me. I am
currently interested in Big Data and Data Analytics issues - courses and conferences on Udemy
and I read articles. I am also have learned the Tableau tool, SQL languages and ETL processes.
I also train Python as a language that offers great opportunities for a software and data
engineer. I am also expanding my knowledge of telecommunications (TCP / IP), LTE networks,
which seem to be more and more interesting to me. I am aware that I am currently presenting
entry level but I also know how valuable a team member I can be when I take part in an
interesting project. In my work I follow values like:
• Be focused on team and company goals and their effective delivery,
• Feels accountable for the team performance,
• Builds trust by showing and admitting their vulnerabilities,
• Debates productively within the whole company,
• Be able to listen and react constructively to ideas from more and less experienced
people,
• Shares team's failures openly and constructively,
• Leads by example in both technical and organisational domains,
• Reacts with pragmatism and positivity in the face of challenging situations,
• Be great at sharing information,
• Challenges others,
• Gives constructive feedback,
